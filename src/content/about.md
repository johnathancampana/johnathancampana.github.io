Hi, I'm John. I live in Boston, where I'm currently studying at [**Harvard Business School**](https://www.hbs.edu) and focused on building and scaling software businesses. **I am looking for a high-ownership role where I can drive commercial growth.**

Before HBS, I built software and designed products to show prescription drug prices to hundreds of thousands of customers at [**Amazon Pharmacy**](https://pharmacy.amazon.com), reduced dataset transformation times from hours to minutes at [**Viasat**](https://www.viasat.com), and studied **Computer Science** at [**UMass Amherst**](https://www.cics.umass.edu).

Outside of work, I enjoy reading fiction and am addicted to Zone 2 aerobic exercise.
