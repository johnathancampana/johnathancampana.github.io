                <p>
                    In my last summer of college, I was invited to join a team at <a href="https://www.viasat.com/"
                        target="_blank">Viasat</a>
                    where I built an internal tool. This was a unique
                    oppurtuntunity where I was able to see a project all the way through its lifecycle. It was also my first
                    time working with another intern which was a great experience. At Viasat, I learned the ins and
                    outs of Clojure, remote work, and developing software in an Agile environment.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I began the summer <a href="https://www.braveclojure.com/clojure-for-the-brave-and-true/"
                        target="_blank">learning
                    </a>about <a href="https://clojure.org/" target="_blank">Clojure</a>, a functional programming language
                    and dialect of
                    Lisp. While I had done some functional programming in Javascript, learning Clojure was certainly a
                    paradigm shift. By the end of the summer, I used it to build a command line tool for viewing and
                    editting the contents of a heirarchical namespace, as well as <a
                        href="http://mally.stanford.edu/~sr/computing/basic-unix.html" target="_blank"
                        title="Well, not quite all of those!">navigating the namespace like a filesystem</a>. Although we took on most
                    of the CLI work ourselves, my fellow intern and I were a part of a larger <a
                        href="https://agilemanifesto.org/">Agile</a> team.
                </p>
                <p>
                    After a couple days of learning Clojure and getting set up to work remotely, our project began with a
                    breakdown of an epic. With our manager, we reviewed the expectations of the project and broke down the
                    work into smaller, pointed stories. Each sprint, we took on a few stories and within the two weeks,
                    submitted all of our code, responded to code reviews, and gave demos to a product owner. Because I was
                    working on a team, and our project was bundled into a larger repository, my ability to use git improved
                    dramatically. My manager introduced me to a tool called <a href="https://www.syntevo.com/smartgit/"
                        target="_blank">SmartGit</a>, which was a lifesaver. In addition to learning quite a bit about Clojure and Git, I was also able to get used to effectively working from home.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Like many others, the COVID-19 pandemic forced us at Viasat to work remotely. Over the course of the
                    summer, I got better at communicating online effectively,
                    drawing the line between work and leisure, and managing my time.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I really enjoyed my summer at Viasat despite the atypical circumstance. The folks that were using the
                    tool we built really appreciated our efforts and emphasized how it would not only save them time, but also providing a visual aid for a complex system.

                <p>
                    During the fall of my junior year, I was lucky enough to spend a semester abroad in Barcelona working
                    with some great folks over at <a href="https://www.dribba.com/" target="_blank">Dribba</a>. My time at
                    Dribba was
                    dedicated to building an app for <a href="https://leanin.org/" target="_blank">Lean In</a>. Despite not
                    having any experience building
                    mobile apps, I was able to get the hang of it using <a href="https://flutter.dev/Flutter"
                        target="_blank">Flutter</a>, a toolkit from
                    Google that uses the Dart programming language. The app debuted at the 2019 Lean In Conference in the
                    Netherlands with 350+ downloads.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Aside from spending an unforgettable semester in Barcelona, I also took away quite a bit from my time at
                    Dribba. I learned a new programming language, got to work with people around the globe, and built my
                    first mobile app! Even going in to my third year as a computer science major, being asked to build an app almost
                    entirely from scratch was a daunting task. Yet, after a few weeks on the job, some help from my colleagues at Dribba, and
                    countless Google searches I got used to the process. I loved working on a small project where I could see the changes I was making
                    instantly reflected in the UI and behavior of the app. It was the first time I had built something that people
                    would actually use and that felt pretty great!
