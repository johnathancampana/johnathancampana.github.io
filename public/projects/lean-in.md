# Case Study: Building the "Lean In" App from Scratch in Spain

**TL;DR:** During a semester abroad in Barcelona, I worked as a Product Engineer for Dribba, a digital consultancy. Despite having no prior mobile experience, I taught myself Flutter/Dart to build and launch the official mobile app for the Lean In Foundation, debuting it to 350+ attendees at their European conference.

### The Problem: A Digital Gap for the Conference
The Lean In Foundation, a global community dedicated to empowering women, was preparing for its 2019 European Conference in the Netherlands. They needed a dedicated mobile platform to facilitate networking, share schedules, and engage attendees.

However, the project had strict constraints: a hard deadline (the conference date) and the need for a cross-platform solution (iOS and Android) without doubling the development time.

### The Challenge & Solution
This project was a test of my adaptability. As an undergraduate with strong CS fundamentals but no mobile development experience, I was dropped into a client-facing role in a foreign country.

**1. The Technical Leap: Learning Flutter**
To meet the cross-platform requirement, we chose Flutter, a toolkit from Google using the Dart language.
* **Rapid Upskilling:** I went from "Hello World" to shipping production code in weeks. I leveraged documentation and received from some great mentorship to master the widget-based architecture of Flutter.
* **Full-Stack Ownership:** I built the app entirely from scratch, handling everything from the UI/UX implementation to the data layer.

**2. Stakeholder Management**
Working at an agency (Dribba) meant balancing two bosses: my internal technical leads and the external client (Lean In).
* **Bridging the Gap:** I facilitated alignment on UX tradeoffs and feature prioritization. When timeline pressures mounted, I helped negotiate the "Go-to-Market" strategy to ensure we shipped a stable, high-value MVP in time for the event.

### The Impact
The app successfully launched on both the App Store and Google Play Store in time for the 2019 Lean In Conference.

* **Adoption:** The app saw 350+ downloads immediately upon launch, serving as the digital hub for the conference.
* **Reliability:** It performed without critical failure during the event, proving that a "learning" project could deliver enterprise-grade stability.

### Retrospective: What I Learned
* **The Joy of "Product" Engineering:** Coming from academic coursework and a large corporate internship, this was my first taste of immediate feedback loops. Seeing a line of code instantly change a button on a screen was very exciting.
* **Learning to Learn:** Being forced to learn a new skill under a tight deadline gave me the confidence that by working hard and setting realistic expectations, I can handle any task even if it is initially intimidating.
* **Global Collaboration:** Working in a Spanish firm for a client in the Netherlands taught me how to navigate cultural and communication nuances in a professional setting.
