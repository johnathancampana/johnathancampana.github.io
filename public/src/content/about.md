## Hi, I'm John.

I live in Boston, where I'm currently studying at [**Harvard Business School**](https://www.hbs.edu) and exploring new opportunities to build and scale software businesses. 

I am looking to join a great team at a fast-growing organization in a high-ownership role where my engineering experience is an asset, but I can develop my **product, strategy, and sales skillset**.

Before HBS, I built software and designed products to show prescription drug prices to hundreds of thousands of customers at [**Amazon Pharmacy**](https://pharmacy.amazon.com), reduced dataset transformation times from hours to minutes at [Viasat](https://www.viasat.com), and studied **Computer Science** at [UMass Amherst](https://www.cics.umass.edu).

Outside of work, I enjoy reading fiction and am addicted to the endorphins released by Zone 2 aerobic exercise.

If anything on my website catches your interest, message me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/johnathan-campana/) or send me an [email](mailto:johnathanrcampana@gmail.com)!
