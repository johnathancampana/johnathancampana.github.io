            <p>
                Hi, my name is Johnathan Campana. I am a junior studying computer science at the University
                of Massachusetts, Amherst. Outside of the classroom, I enjoy rowing and playing basketball 
                with friends or reading a good book. This website will be a look in to my life, mostly highlighting
                my professional experience.
